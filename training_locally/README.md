# Training an Object Detection Model Locally

TensorFlow should be installed correctly on your system

You will need Python 2 if you are on linux or Python 3 on windows. PIP is also required.

## Image Gathering

To train a model using TensorFlow's object detection API, we first need to gather enough input data to create the model. 
A good model for our purposes needs > 100 images of medium (300 x 300) quality. The images should be taken at multiple angles and distances and with varying surroundings. It is prefereable to have the images in JPEG format. Remove all the spaces in the filenames as well.

Create a folder called `images` and `annotations`. Inside the images folder, for each class, create a new folder and place all of their images in there. The structure of your folder should look like this. It is advisable to place these folders into this current directory

```
images
    class_a
        file_1.jpg
        file_2.jpg
        ...
annotations
    file_1.xml
    file_2.xml
    ...
```
incase you have .png images please convert them to .jpg using the following script in python3
```
from glob import glob                                                           
from PIL import Image

pngs = glob('./*.png')

for j in pngs:
	im = Image.open(j)
	rgb_im = im.convert('RGB')
	rgb_im.save(j[:-3] + 'jpg')
```

## Annotating

Once the images have been collected it is time to annotate the images. clone our version of labelimg [here](https://github.com/uvic-auvic/labelimg) and run it with Python 3. You may need to install a few dependencies such as PyQt5 and lxml. Once that is working make sure that the output format is set to Pascal VOC. 

Make sure that ALL of the xmls are being saved into the `annotations` folder

## Downloading TensorFlow-Models

TensorFlow models is the research project which brings us the object detection API. Clone their repo [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models). Add its location to the PYTHONPATH. 

On windows that can be done with this command

```
set PYTHONPATH="C:\path\to\models;C:\path\to\models\research;C:\path\to\models\research\slim;C:\path\to\models\research\object_detection"
```

On Linux

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/models:/path/to/models/researc:/path/to/models/research/slim:/path/to/models/research/object_detection
```

It is important to note that the relevant subdirectories of models need to get added as well.
Once that has been added to path, we need to compile the protocol buffer classes.
Install the protocol buffer application from the instructions [here](https://github.com/google/protobuf) and enter the research directory of tensorflow/models/
Assuming, protoc has been added to your path, run the command 
`protoc --python_out=. object_detection/protos/*.proto`

This command may not work on windows, because of globbing, and you may have to list out every .proto file in that directory manually.

## Creating the TF records

After all the images have been annotated, create a file called `annotation.pbtext`. In this file you should list all the classes you want to build your model around. The structure should look like this

```
item {
    id: 1
    name: 'buoy'
}

item {
    id: 2
    name: 'gate'
}
...
```

You should also modify the generate_tf_record.py file to return the same values as is listed in the `class_text_to_int` function.

Now all that is left to be done is to run the script `generate_tf_record.py`. This will generate the binary record file that we can work with. If all goes well you should see a `train.record` and `val.record` in your directory.

## Creating the Pipeline Config

To train a model, we need to specify parameters such as number of classes and number of iterations to train on. First we need to download an existing model, one that we are retraining and specify our files.

The model we are using is called SSD Mobilenet, which is a lightweight but less accurate model. Download the SSD Mobilenet V1 Coco model from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md) and copy the extracted folder into our current directory.

Next we need to find the SSD pipeline config from [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection/samples/configs) and copy that into our directory as well. 
There are a few things we need to change in the config file such as: 

- num_classes: set to the number of classes yoru are detecting

- fine_tune_checkpoint: set to the directory of the downloaded SSD model.cpkt file

- num_steps: limit this to the max amount of steps you want to perform. Typcally something from 20,000 - 40,000 is enough to get accurate results

- input_path: set to the `train.record` and `val.record` respectively

- label_map_path: set to the `annotations.pbtxt` file

- num_examples: set this to the number of images you are evaluating. This should have been printed out when generating the record files.

It is important to note that the paths should use forward slashes (`/`) even if you are on windows.

Now that the records have been generated, it is time to start training.
Run the following command:

```
# use python3 if you are on windows
python /path/to/models/research/object_detection/train.py --logtostderr --train_dir=training --pipeline_config_path=ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco.config  
```

If everything is setup correctly training should start, and checkpoint files will be saved periodically.

## Export Inference Graph

By default tensorflow generates models in a split-file format. Typically it's nicer to work with frozen inference graph, which is the graph files all compressed into a single file protocol buffer format. To create this graph run the following command:

```
python /path/to/models/research/object_detection/export_inference_graph.py --input_type image_tensor --pipeline_config_path ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco.config --trained_checkpoint_prefix training/model.cpkt-XXXX --output_directory inference_graph
# replace the XXXX with the latest number in your training directory
``` 

the frozen graph should be saved into the inference_graph directory as frozen_inference_graph.pb. You should now be able to execute your model.
Checkout [inference](/inference) for some sameple scripts to get you running.
